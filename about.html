        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          My journey into development started with
          <strong>C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms</strong>, where I built a
          strong foundation in logical thinking and problem-solving.
          Understanding how things work at a core level shaped the way I
          approach every project — focusing not just on writing code, but
          writing efficient and structured solutions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          After mastering the fundamentals, I transitioned into
          <strong>Web Development</strong>, building responsive and interactive
          applications using <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React</strong>.
          I enjoy transforming ideas into clean, user-friendly interfaces that
          deliver real value.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Currently, I am strengthening my backend expertise with the
          <strong>MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)</strong>,
          working on authentication systems, RESTful APIs, and database-driven
          applications. My goal is to build scalable, secure, and
          production-ready applications — not just tutorial projects.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I am continuously improving my
          <strong
            >problem-solving skills, system design thinking, and full-stack
            development capabilities</strong
          >
          to grow into a well-rounded software engineer.
